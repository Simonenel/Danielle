					<p>Abstract</p>
					<p>Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) has been shown to have various health benefits including antidiabetic, lipid-lowering, and hepatoprotective properties. Although anecdotally Rooibos consumption is regarded as safe, recently, two case studies have associated chronic consumption of Rooibos with conventional prescription medications, such as atorvastatin, with hepatotoxicity. The cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, act by competitively inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Although rare in occurrence, statins are potentially hepatotoxic. The safety of the concurrent use of Rooibos and statins thus needs to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between the potential hepatoprotective effects of Rooibos and statin-induced hepatotoxicity using an in vitro C3A liver cell model. The effects of the co-treatment on cell viability, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial integrity and cellular ROS production were assessed in a C3A liver cell culture model. A significant increase in ROS production was observed in C3A cells exposed to 25 µM ATV and palmitate (353.10% ± 262.70 vs. 1431.00% ± 504.2). Similar results were seen following ATV and GRT combination therapy (845.00% ± 589.60 vs. 1493.00% ± 278.4). Under hyperlipidaemic conditions, ATV induced significant increases in apoptosis (19.50% ± 3.56 vs. 52.83% ± 7.14) which was not ameliorated by GRT co-treatment (13.83% ± 2.79). It was shown that GRT was unable to modulate the hepatotoxic effects induced by ATV or palmitate in this model.</p>

							<p>Danielle,</p>
							<p>You have given me the most precious thing in this world... your heart. I know it was not easy to give it to someone and trust them with your heart, but I am glad you chose me. I have placed your heart in the space where mine was, and I gave mine to you. Thank you for trusting me with your heart, your hopes and dreams. I will keep them all safe and I will always encourage you and if it is in my power enable you to follow your dreams. You have changed my life and I will never be able to thank you enough, but I will continue to try and show you, because words aren't enough.</p>
							<p>You are my Sun. You are my world. You are my life. You are my love. You are my heart.</p>
					    <p>I LOVE YOU</p>

							<p>Abstract</p>
							<p>You are what I want. You are what I need. I, we both say, that we chose each other, but I think we were made for each other. It doesn’t matter how we got together, the point is that we are together and we are good together. I love you the way you are. I fell in love with you just the way you are. You are perfect to me.
	I love everything about you. I will never tell you that you are too much, you are not too much for me. The people that told you that in the past, clearly cannot handle much and are weak. They do not and did not deserve you. Don’t you dare think that I will ever tell you that you are too much or I do not like that you do certain things that are fundamentally you. Yes, we are two independent and different individuals in a romantic and loving relationship. We will want and need different things from each other and need to compromise on certain things, and we do have disagreements, but that is what happens in a healthy and normal relationship. I will never ever tell you to stop being who you are. I will never tell you to change who you are as a person. I adore who you are, my opinionated, formidable, funny – dark humour and sarcasm, brilliant, fierce, extraordinary, wife. All that you are is what I want and need. You need to understand that I love every part of you. I love the parts that you don’t like. I will never complain about anything that you are, because it is who you are.
	Whatever you think is a problem for me or will be a problem for me, stop. Do not think it will be. I am not the people you have dated before; I was made for you, I chose you. I accept you for who and what you are. I want to understand you, so let me understand you. I do get it wrong sometimes, and we disagree, but the beautiful thing about us is that we talk. I am not in this relationship to change you and to make you into someone that you are not. I do not want to control you. I am in this relationship because of who you are, you keep me on my toes, woman. You challenge me, you make me laugh, you stimulate my brain, you make my heart skip a beat, you make me forget to breath. I need you to be you, in all your glory. I am strong enough and willing enough to handle you, if you think that you are too much. I can however tell you, that to me, you are anything but too much. All I see is my wife and I love and adore you so much. I do not care what others think.
	You, Danielle, you are enough for me. All of you is perfect to me. You say that I should not call you perfect, but you are perfect to me. All your imperfections make you perfect to me, and I love and adore all of your imperfections and perfections.</p>

<p>You are mine; you are what I want, you are what I need. Don’t you dare change.</p>
<p>You are mine.</p>
<p>You are perfect.</p>
<p>You are enough.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>

<p>Yours</p>
<p>Simoné</p>
